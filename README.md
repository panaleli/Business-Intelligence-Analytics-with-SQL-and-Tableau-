# Business-Intelligence-Analytics-with-SQL-and-Tableau

# Part 1
We use Execute SQL ​tab in ​DB Browser ​to answer the following questions
(see​ ​https://www.sqlite.org/draft/lang.html​) :
● Provide the latitude and longitude for each id_request.
● How many requests per day happened during week 11, 2018 and during previous week?
● Provide a list of active passengers sorted descending by volume of rides.
Active passengers: Passengers who have at least 1 ​completed ​ride
● What was the request to ride ratio per weekday and per hour?
● How many rides per day were ​completed ​using cash and how many using a credit card?

# Part 2
We create a Demand Dashboard ​for week 11, 2018 ​using the csv files and Tableau Public
(​https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/​) which will include charts that answer the following questions:
● Provide a latitude, longitude combination where most requests happened. Which
building in the area might explain the high requests volume?
● Which weekday of week 11 had the biggest growth when compared to the same
weekday of week 10? Can you notice any seasonality in terms of requests volume?
● Which are the top 10 active passengers?
● During which hours of each weekday of week 11, request to ride ratio was low? 
● Which day had the lowest credit card rides share?
